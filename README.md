# Todo List of Arc Finding Project


### 0. SDSS-like Toy Training Set.
- [x] Lensed arcs of galaxies from COSMOS.
- [x] Pin galaxies of the lens according to the properties of its density profile.
- [x] Add noise and psf according to SDSS observation.
- [x] Calibrating the flux values of the galaxies from COSMOS and SDSS.


### 1. DES-like and LSST-like images.
- [ ] Producing 10000 simulated images for DES and LSST.
- [ ] Inputting these simulated images into the pipeline and make it running.
- [ ] Try CFHTLens too? For example, use the mock catalog from [SpaceWraps](http://spacewarps.org).
- [ ] Release the standard training set based on the Illustris simulation or Eagle simulation (Led by Argonne, Paper I).
- [ ] Find out the best machine learning pipeline for arc finding (Led by CMU, Paper II).
- [ ] Find out the best preprocessing on input images for arc finding (Led by UChicago, Paper III).
