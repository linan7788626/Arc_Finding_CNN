# Todo List of Arc Finding Project

## Produce Simulated Training Set
### 0. SDSS-like Toy Training Set .
- [x] Lensed arcs of galaxies from COSMOS.
- [x] Pin galaxies of the lens according to the properties of its density profile.
- [x] Add noise and psf according to SDSS observation.
- [ ] Calibrating the flux values of the galaxies from COSMOS and SDSS. 
- [ ] Inputting these simulated images into the pipeline and make it running.
- [ ] Try CFHTLens too? For example, use the mock catalog from [SpaceWraps](http://spacewarps.org).

### 1. More Realistic Simulated Images.
Coming soon...
