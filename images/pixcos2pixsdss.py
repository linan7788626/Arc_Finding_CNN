#The conversion between the value of ACS pix to SDSS pixel is simple.
#The ACS pix value after drizzle is in unit of electrons/seconds which
#is physical and SDSS should have the same electrons/seconds from the same
# source. But the exposure time is only 53 seconds for SDSS, so the conversion
# is just ACS pixel value \time 53/gain. Here gain is the parameter for SDSS
# CCD relating electrons to DN(Data Number from CCD).
